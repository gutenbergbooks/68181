<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p class="p4">It is a very real pleasure to address
this body of citizens of Missouri here in
the great city of St. Louis. I have often
visited St. Louis before, but always by
rail. Now I am visiting it in the course
of a trip by water, a trip on the great
natural highway which runs past your
very doors—a highway once so important,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
now almost abandoned, which I
hope this nation will see not only restored
to all its former usefulness, but given a
far greater degree of usefulness to correspond
with the extraordinary growth in
wealth and population of the Mississippi
Valley. We have lived in an era of
phenomenal railroad building. As routes
for merchandise, the iron highways have
completely supplanted the old wagon
roads, and under their competition the
importance of the water highways has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
been much diminished. The growth of
the railway system has been rapid all
over the world, but nowhere so rapid as
in the United States. Accompanying this
there has grown in the United States
a tendency toward the practically complete
abandonment of the system of
water transportation. Such a tendency is
certainly not healthy and I am convinced
that it will not be permanent. There are
many classes of commodities, especially
those which are perishable in their nature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
and where the value is high relatively to
the bulk, which will always be carried by
rail. But bulky commodities which are
not of a perishable nature will always be
specially suited for the conditions of water
transport. To illustrate the truth of this
statement it would only be necessary to
point to the use of the canal system in
many countries of the Old World; but it
can be illustrated even better by what has
happened nearer home. The Great Lakes
offer a prime example of the importance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
of a good water highway for mercantile
traffic. As the line of traffic runs through
lakes, the conditions are in some respects
different from what must obtain on even
the most important river. Nevertheless,
it is well to remember that a very large
part of this traffic is conditioned upon an
artificial waterway, a canal—the famous
Soo. The commerce that passes through
the Soo far surpasses in bulk and in value
that of the Suez Canal.</p>
</div>

<p>From every standpoint it is desirable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
for the Nation to join in improving the
greatest system of river highways within
its borders, a system second only in importance
to the highway afforded by the
Great Lakes; the highways of the Mississippi
and its great tributaries, such as the
Missouri and Ohio. This river system
traverses too many States to render it
possible to leave merely to the States the
task of fitting it for the greatest use of
which it is capable. It is emphatically a
national task, for this great river system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
is itself one of our chief national assets.
Within the last few years there has been
an awakening in this country to the need
of both the conservation and the development
of our national resources under the
supervision of and by the aid of the Federal
Government. This is especially true
of all that concerns our running waters.
On the mountains from which the springs
start we are now endeavoring to preserve
the forests which regulate the water supply
and prevent too startling variations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
between droughts and freshets. Below
the mountains, in the high dry regions
of the western plains, we endeavor to
secure the proper utilization of the waters
for irrigation. This is at the sources of
the streams. Farther down, where they
become navigable, our aim must be to try
to develop a policy which shall secure the
utmost advantage from the navigable
waters. Finally, on the lower courses of
the Mississippi, the Nation should do its
full share in the work of levee building;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
and, incidentally to its purpose of serving
navigation, this will also prevent the ruin
of alluvial bottoms by floods. Our knowledge
is not sufficiently far advanced to
enable me to speak definitely as to the
plans which should be adopted; but let me
say one word of warning: The danger of
entering on any such scheme lies in the
adoption of impossible and undesirable
plans, plans the adoption of which means
an outlay of money extravagant beyond
all proportion to the return, or which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
though feasible, are not, relatively to other
plans, of an importance which warrant their
adoption. It will not be easy to secure
the assent of a fundamentally cautious
people like our own to the adoption of
such a policy as that I hope to see adopted;
and even if we begin to follow out such a
policy it certainly will not be persevered
in if it is found to entail reckless extravagance
or to be tainted with jobbery. The
interests of the Nation as a whole must
be always the first consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>This is properly a national movement,
because all interstate and foreign commerce,
and the improvements and methods
of carrying it on, are subjects for national
action. Moreover, while of course the
matter of the improvement of the Mississippi
River and its tributaries is one which
especially concerns the great middle portion
of our country, the region between
the Alleghenies and the Rockies, yet it is
of concern to the rest of the country
also, for it can not too often be said that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
whatever is really beneficial to one part of
our country is ultimately of benefit to the
whole. Exactly as it is a good thing for
the interior of our country that the seaports
on the Atlantic and the Pacific and
the Gulf should be safe and commodious,
so it is to the interest of the dwellers on
the coast that the interior should possess
ample facilities for the transportation of
its products. Our interests are all closely
interwoven, and in the long run it will be
found that we go up or go down together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>Take, for instance, the Panama Canal.
If the Mississippi is restored to its former
place of importance as a highway of commerce,
then the building of the Panama
Canal will be felt as an immediate advantage
to the business of every city and
country district in the Mississippi Valley.
I think that the building of that canal will
be of especial advantage to the States that
lie along the Pacific and the States that
lie along the Gulf; and yet, after all, I feel
that the advantage will be shared in an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
only less degree by the States of the interior
and of the Atlantic coast. In other
words, it is a thoroughly national work,
undertaken for and redounding to the
advantage of all of us—to the advantage of
the Nation as a whole. Therefore I am
glad to be able to report to you how well
we are doing with the canal. There is
bound to be a certain amount of experiment,
a certain amount of feeling our way,
in a task so gigantic—a task greater than
any of its kind that has ever hitherto been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
undertaken in the whole history of mankind;
but the success so far has been
astonishing, and we have not met
with a single one of the accidents
or drawbacks which I freely confess I
expected we should from time to time
encounter. We, in the first place, laid the
foundation for the work by securing the
most favorable possible conditions as regard
the health, comfort, and safety of
the men who were to do it; and now the
Canal Zone is in point of health better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
off than the average district of the same
size at home. Then we went at the problem
of the actual digging and dam building.
For over a year past we have been
engaged in making the dirt fly in good
earnest, and the output of the giant steam
shovels has steadily increased. It is now
the rainy season, when work is most difficult
on the Isthmus, yet in the month of
August last we excavated over a million
and two hundred thousand cubic yards of
earth and rock, a greater amount than in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
any previous month. If we are able to
keep up substantially the rate of progress
that now obtains we shall finish the actual
digging within five or six years; though
when we come to the great Gatun dam and
locks, while there is no question as to the
work being feasible, there are several elements
entering into the time problem
which make it unwise at present to hazard
a prophecy in reference thereto.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, this leads me up to
another matter for national consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
and that is our Navy. The Navy is not
primarily of importance only to the coast
regions. It is every bit as much the concern
of the farmer who dwells a thousand
miles from sea water as of the fisherman
who makes his living on the ocean, for it
is the concern of every good American who
knows what the meaning of the word patriotism
is. This country is definitely committed
to certain fundamental policies—to
the Monroe doctrine, for instance, and to
the duty not only of building, but, when it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
is built, of policing and defending the Panama
Canal. We have definitely taken our
place among the great world powers, and
it would be a sign of ignoble weakness,
having taken such a place, to shirk its responsibilities.
Therefore, unless we are
willing to abandon this place, to abandon
our insistence upon the Monroe doctrine,
to give up the Panama Canal, and to be
content to acknowledge ourselves a weak
and timid nation, we must steadily build
up and maintain a great fighting Navy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Our Navy is already so efficient as to be a
matter of just pride to every American.
So long as our Navy is no larger than at
present, it must be considered as an elementary
principle that the bulk of our
battle fleet must always be kept together.
When the Panama Canal is built it can be
transferred without difficulty from one part
of our coast to the other; but even before
that canal is built it ought to be thus transferred
to and fro from time to time. In
a couple of months our fleet of great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
armored ships starts for the Pacific. California,
Oregon, and Washington have a
coast line which is our coast line just as
emphatically as the coast line of New York
and Maine, of Louisiana and Texas. Our
fleet is going to its own home waters in the
Pacific, and after a stay there it will return
to its own home waters in the Atlantic.
The best place for a naval officer to learn
his duties is at sea, by performing them, and
only by actually putting through a voyage
of this nature, a voyage longer than any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
ever before undertaken by as large a fleet
of any nation, can we find out just exactly
what is necessary for us to know as to our
naval needs and practice our officers and
enlisted men in the highest duties of their
profession. Among all our citizens there
is no body of equal size to whom we owe
quite as much as to the officers and
enlisted men of the Army and Navy
of the United States, and I bespeak
from you the fullest and heartiest support,
in the name of our Nation and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
our flag, for the services to which these
men belong.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to say a word to
this body, containing as it does so many
business men, upon what is preeminently
a business proposition, and that is the
proper national supervision and control of
corporations. At the meeting of the American
Bar Association in this last August,
Judge Charles F. Amidon, of North
Dakota, read a paper on the Nation and the
Constitution so admirable that it is deserving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
of very wide study; for what he said
was, as all studies of law in its highest
form ought to be, a contribution to constructive
jurisprudence as it should be
understood not only by judges but by
legislators, not only by those who interpret
and decide the law, but by those who
make it and who administer or execute
it. He quoted from the late Justice
Miller, of the Supreme Court, to show
that even in the interpretation of the
Constitution by this, the highest authority<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
of the land, the court’s successive decisions
must be tested by the way they work in
actual application to the National life; the
court adding to its thought and study the results
of experience and observation until the
true solution is evolved by a process both
of inclusion and exclusion. Said Justice
Miller: “The meaning of the Constitution is
to be sought as much in the National life
as in the dictionary;” for, as has been well
said, government purely out of a law library
can never be really good government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>Now that the questions of government
are becoming so largely economic, the majority
of our so-called constitutional cases
really turn not upon the interpretation of
the instrument itself, but upon the construction,
the right apprehension of the living
conditions to which it is to be applied. The
Constitution is now and must remain what
it always has been; but it can only be interpreted
as the interests of the whole people
demand, if interpreted as a living organism,
designed to meet the conditions of life and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
not of death; in other words, if interpreted
as Marshall interpreted it, as Wilson declared
it should be interpreted. The Marshall
theory, the theory of life and not of
death, allows to the Nation, that is to the
people as a whole, when once it finds a
subject within the national cognizance, the
widest and freest choice of methods for
national control, and sustains every exercise
of national power which has any reasonable
relation to national objects. The
negation of this theory means, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
that the Nation—that we, the ninety
millions of people of this country—will be
left helpless to control the huge corporations
which now domineer in our industrial
life, and that they will have the authority of
the courts to work their desires unchecked;
and such a decision would in the end be
as disastrous for them as for us. If the
theory of the Marshall school prevails, then
an immense field of national power, now
unused, will be developed, which will be
adequate for dealing with many, if not all,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
of the economic problems which vex us;
and we shall be saved from the ominous
threat of a constant oscillation between
economic tyranny and economic chaos.
Our industrial, and therefore our social,
future as a Nation depends upon settling
aright this urgent question.</p>

<p>The Constitution is unchanged and
unchangeable save by amendment in due
form. But the conditions to which it is to
be applied have undergone a change which
is almost a transformation, with the result<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
that many subjects formerly under the
control of the States have come under the
control of the Nation. As one of the justices
of the Supreme Court has recently
said: “The growth of national powers,
under our Constitution, which marks merely
the great outlines and designates only the
great objects of national concern, is to be
compared to the growth of a country not
by the geographical enlargement of its
boundaries, but by the increase of its population.”
A hundred years ago there was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
except the commerce which crawled along
our seacoast or up and down our interior
waterways, practically no interstate commerce.
Now, by the railroad, the mails,
the telegraph, and the telephone an immense
part of our commerce is interstate.
By the transformation it has escaped from
the power of the State and come under the
power of the Nation. Therefore there has
been a great practical change in the exercise
of the National power, under the acts
of Congress, over interstate commerce;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
while on the other hand there has been no
noticeable change in the exercise of the
National power “to regulate commerce
with foreign nations and with the Indian
tribes.” The change as regards interstate
commerce has been, not in the Constitution,
but in the business of the people to
which it is to be applied. Our economic
and social future depends in very large
part upon how the interstate commerce
power of the Nation is interpreted.</p>

<p>I believe that the Nation has the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
governmental power over interstate commerce
and the widest discretion in dealing
with that subject; of course under the
express limits prescribed in the Constitution
for the exercise of all powers, such for
instance as the condition that “due process
of law” shall not be denied. The Nation
has no direct power over purely intrastate
commerce, even where it is conducted by
the same agencies which conduct interstate
commerce. The courts must determine
what is national and what is State<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
commerce. The same reasoning which
sustained the power of Congress to incorporate
the United States Bank tends to
sustain the power to incorporate an interstate
railroad, or any other corporation
conducting an interstate business.</p>

<p>There are difficulties arising from our
dual form of government. If they prove
to be insuperable resort must be had to
the power of amendment. Let us first
try to meet them by an exercise of all the
powers of the National Government which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
in the Marshall spirit of broad interpretation
can be found in the Constitution as it is.
They are of vast extent. The chief economic
question of the day in this country
is to provide a sovereign for the great
corporations engaged in interstate business;
that is, for the railroads and the
interstate industrial corporations. At the
moment our prime concern is with the
railroads. When railroads were first built
they were purely local in character.
Their boundaries were not coextensive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
even with the boundaries of one State.
They usually covered but two or three
counties. All this has now changed. At
present five great systems embody nearly
four-fifths of the total mileage of the
country. All the most important railroads
are no longer State roads, but instruments
of interstate commerce. Probably
85 per cent of their business is
interstate business. It is the Nation alone
which can with wisdom, justice, and effectiveness
exercise over these interstate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
railroads the thorough and complete supervision
which should be exercised. One
of the chief, and probably the chief, of the
domestic causes for the adoption of the
Constitution was the need to confer upon
the Nation exclusive control over interstate
commerce. But this grant of power
is worthless unless it is held to confer
thoroughgoing and complete control over
practically the sole instrumentalities of
interstate commerce—the interstate railroads.
The railroads themselves have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
exceedingly shortsighted in the rancorous
bitterness which they have shown against
the resumption by the Nation of this long-neglected
power. Great capitalists, who
pride themselves upon their extreme conservatism,
often believe they are acting in
the interests of property when following a
course so shortsighted as to be really an
assault upon property. They have shown
extreme unwisdom in their violent opposition
to the assumption of complete control
over the railroads by the Federal Government.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
The American people will not
tolerate the happy-go-lucky system of no
control over the great interstate railroads,
with the insolent and manifold abuses
which have so generally accompanied it.
The control must exist somewhere; and
unless it is by thoroughgoing and radical
law placed upon the statute books of the
Nation, it will be exercised in ever-increasing
measure by the several States. The
same considerations which made the founders
of the Constitution deem it imperative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
that the Nation should have complete control
of interstate commerce apply with peculiar
force to the control of interstate railroads
at the present day; and the arguments
of Madison of Virginia, Pinckney
of South Carolina, and Hamilton and Jay
of New York, in their essence apply now
as they applied one hundred and twenty
years ago.</p>

<p>The national convention which framed
the Constitution, and in which almost all
the most eminent of the first generation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
of American statesmen sat, embodied the
theory of the instrument in a resolution,
to the effect that the National Government
should have power in cases where the
separate States were incompetent to act
with full efficiency, and where the harmony
of the United States would be
interrupted by the exercise of such individual
legislation. The interstate railroad
situation is exactly a case in point. There
will, of course, be local matters affecting
railroads which can best be dealt with by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
local authority, but as national commercial
agents the big interstate railroad ought to
be completely subject to national authority.
Only thus can we secure their complete
subjection to, and control by, a single
sovereign, representing the whole people,
and capable both of protecting the public
and of seeing that the railroads neither
inflict nor endure injustice.</p>

<p>Personally I firmly believe that there
should be national legislation to control
all industrial corporations doing an interstate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
business, including the control of the
output of their securities, but as to these
the necessity for Federal control is less
urgent and immediate than is the case
with the railroads. Many of the abuses
connected with these corporations will
probably tend to disappear now that
the Government—the public—is gradually
getting the upper hand as regards
putting a stop to the rebates and
special privileges which some of these
corporations have enjoyed at the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
the common carriers. But ultimately it
will be found that the complete remedy
for these abuses lies in direct and affirmative
action by the National Government.
That there is constitutional power for the
national regulation of these corporations I
have myself no question. Two or three
generations ago there was just as much
hostility to national control of banks as
there is now to national control of railroads
or of industrial corporations doing an interstate
business. That hostility now seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
to us ludicrous in its lack of warrant; in like
manner, gentlemen, our descendants will
regard with wonder the present opposition
to giving the National Government adequate
power to control those great corporations,
which it alone can fully, and yet
wisely, safely, and justly control. Remember
also that to regulate the formation of
these corporations offers one of the most
direct and efficient methods of regulating
their activities.</p>

<p>I am not pleading for an extension of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
constitutional power. I am pleading that
constitutional power which already exists
shall be applied to new conditions which
did not exist when the Constitution went
into being. I ask that the national powers
already conferred upon the National Government
by the Constitution shall be so
used as to bring national commerce and
industry effectively under the authority of
the Federal Government and thereby avert
industrial chaos. My plea is not to bring
about a condition of centralization. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
that the Government shall recognize a condition
of centralization in a field where it
already exists. When the national banking
law was passed it represented in reality
not centralization, but recognition of the
fact that the country had so far advanced
that the currency was already a matter of
National concern and must be dealt with
by the central authority at Washington.
So it is with interstate industrialism and
especially with the matter of interstate railroad
operation to-day. Centralization has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
already taken place in the world of commerce
and industry. All I ask is that the
National Government look this fact in the
face, accept it as a fact, and fit itself accordingly
for a policy of supervision and control
over this centralized commerce and
industry.</p>
